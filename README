This script is a simple bash script that checks the directory (and subdirectories) that it is
run in and tries converting any ISO images to H.264 videos using Handbrake. You will need
dirname installed on your machine along with HandBrakeCLI.

WARNING: It WILL change the extensions of your .iso images to .osi. Comment the second to last
line in the script if you do not want this to happen.

Be sure to edit the script and change "/path/to/converted_movies" to whatever directory you
want the converted files to be placed in. The script is written to create a folder in this
directory with the name of the name of the directory the ISO image is found in. In the case
of subdirectories, the directory name in the converted directory is created with the name of 
the "root" directory and the filename the same as the source file, sans .iso extension. See below for an example.

../Movie Name/A Subdirectory/Another Subdirectory/Example.iso

will result in

../path/to/converted_movies/Movie Name/Example.mp4
